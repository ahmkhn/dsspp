            The idea was initiated by Dr. Rabia Akhtar, who reached out with a vision to create a platform that could bring together minds from around the world. Through brainstorming and collaboration, this concept evolved into the application you see today.

            <p className="mt-4 text-base sm:text-lg md:text-xl lg:text-2xl">
            The journey from idea to reality involved several key processes. Initially, we focused on actualizing the concept by determining how to implement functionality that connects users. This included gathering input and conducting tests with a diverse group of individuals, followed by continuous refinement based on their feedback and experiences.
